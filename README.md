# Design Patterns in C++

### SOLID Design Principles
* Single-responsibility - Classes should have a single purpose.
* Open-closed - Open for extension, closed for modification.
* Liskov Substitution -Behavioral class substitution.
* Interface Segregation - Favor multiple, specific interfaces over a single interface.
* Dependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions not implementations.

### Basic Creational Patterns
* Singleton - Sharing state
* Builder - Simplifying complex object creation
* Prototype - Cloning objects

### Advanced Creational Patterns
* Factory Method - Create objects dynamically by type
* Abstract Factory - Create object families
* Dependency Injection - Decouple dependencies
